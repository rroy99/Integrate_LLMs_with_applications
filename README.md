This project demonstrates how to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications using IBM Cloud's Watson Machine Learning API. The project utilizes Python and Streamlit to create a simple application that communicates with the IBM Watson ML API to perform various language tasks like text generation, question answering, and data extraction.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Anaconda Environment**
- **Python**

### Required Libraries (from `requirements.txt`):

```text
load_dotenv==0.1.0
ibm_watson_machine_learning==1.0.345
ibm-cloud-sdk-core==3.16.7
streamlit==1.31.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
  ```

## Installation
Install Anaconda and configure it as your Python interpreter in VSCode or another IDE.
Open your IDE and use Ctrl + Shift + P to select the Anaconda environment as the interpreter.

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Integrate_LLMs_with_applications.git
 ```
2. Change to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd Integrate_LLMs_with_applications
```

3. Install Dependencies: Run the following commands to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install ibm-watson-machine-learning
pip install ibm-cloud-sdk-core
pip install streamlit
```
4. Running the Application
To run the Python script and use the Watson Machine Learning API, execute:

```bash
python ./demo_wml_api.py
streamlit run demo_wml_api_with_streamlit.py
```

## Result
```bash
python demo_wml_api.py

Prompt: 
 From the following customer complaint, extract 3 factors that caused the customer to be unhappy.
 Put each factor on a new line.

 Customer complaint:
         I just tried to book a flight on your incredibly slow website.  All
         the times and prices were confusing.  I liked being able to compare
         the amenities in economy with business class side by side.  But I
         never got to reserve a seat because I didn't understand the seat map.
         Next time, I'll use a travel agent!


 Numbered list of all the factors that caused the customer to be unhappy:


List of complaints: 1. Slow website
 2. Confusing times and prices
 3. Lack of understanding of the seat map
